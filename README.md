# Data Augmentation Technique for Degraded Images without Losing the Classification Ability of Clean Images

This project provides a data augmentation technique for degraded images without the classification ability of clean images.


## Training
You can train networks by `python cnn_train.py`.
Regarding detailed settings, please check the code.

## Evaluation
You can evaluate networks by `python cnn_evaluate.py`.
Regarding detailed settings, please check the code.

## Note
This project uses the RAdam optimizer and the TINYImageNet dataset.
Please prepare them as you need.
